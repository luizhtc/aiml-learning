This repo has the labs and studies that I used to complete a full AI/ML Udemy course. Started in 2024 and ended 2025.

# Udemy Course and Link
All the information on the Udemy Course can be found [HERE](https://www.udemy.com/course/inteligencia-artificial-e-machine-learning/).

I did not write the code from scratch, but I adapted and modified it to run in my environment in a way that made sense while following the lectures and completing the labs for study.

All the credit and thanks goes to the course instructor Fernando Amaral.

# Steps to reproduce
All data needed is inside the "data" folder.

Required python version >= 3.8

Create a virtual environment and run requirements.txt.

Run the notebooks and watch the results.
